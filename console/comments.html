What can monospace do then? I want to like it but it did not do much when I tried some commands.

<p>
Today there was nothing at all, only black background.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Daniel, Germany</i></font>

<p>
Please explain to me what this is.
<br>It's kind of strange but I like it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Calle, Sweden</i></font>

<p>
How do I use this thing without plugging something?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Francis, Germany</i></font>

<p>
Not good at all for that monitor to turn it on and off really fast...
<br>Very nice button.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>GJ Mulder, The Netherlands</i></font>

<p>
Gimme more input.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Joerg, Germany</i></font>

<p>
help...need...instructions....cannot make sense.....
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Kraig, USA</i></font>

<p>
P.S.  I guess I'm dense, what do you do to get beyond the command prompt?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Laura, USA</i></font>

<p>
Lauren is out of the office until Friday. She will not be checking her e-mails while she is away. In case of emergency please leave a message on her voice mail.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Lauren, USA</i></font>

<p>
I think the world is safe for the moment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Jim, USA</i></font>

<p>
Felicidades.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Luis, Colombia</i></font>

<p>
Need more information...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Michel, USA</i></font>

<p>
I guess the computer won.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Mikael, Sweden</i></font>

<p>
Pretty swell.
<br>I was wondering when "eliza" would make it to shockwave.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Mark, USA</i></font>


<p>
Man, I think reading the FAQ you put up there was more fun than playing the OS.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Rob, USA</i></font>

<p>
My office PC locked up when I started the program.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Witold, The Netherlands</i></font>

<p>
Is the plan to kill PCs ?
<br>It took my IE4 and NN3 and killed both dead.
<br>For the 30 seconds I watched the "monospace" float around the screen I was ....impressed :}

<p>
Not working at all so doesn't conquer anything else than frustration.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Ren&eacute;, Canada</i></font>

<p>
I also like to have it look good at all window sizes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Internetjoe, USA</i></font>

<p>
Pretty cool. Terminal emulation within a shockwave movie with its own OS...
Tried a couple a Linux commands - they worked fine. Techniques are really
moving together.

<p>
Please tell us "<code>how to do stuff in monospace.</code>"
<br>Sorry if that sounds harsh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Zav, USA</i></font>

<p>
I like it. Not sure if I like a PC that answers back though, the Mac at home is lippy enough at the best of times.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Christian, USA</i></font>

<p>
I would quite like to see it, it looks like a cool marketing scam.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1><i>Louis, UK</i></font>

<p>
Sucks. Can't get out of an infinite loop after typing in: "<code>Do you have anything other than silly answers?</code>" on the command line. This OS is a no-brainer. It's user-friendly like Win 3.11. It's not between me and the screen it is in the middle 


of nothing. Did you hire Gates Myrboy to do this?
