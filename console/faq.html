<h1>Welcome to the monospace FAQ.</h1>

<p>
This document attempts to answer some common questions about the system. If your question isn't answered here send an e-mail to <a href="http://www.monospace.com/contact.html">I_still_have_a_question@monospace.com</a>.

<ul>
<p>
<b>Q:</b> What is monospace?
<br>
<b>A:</b> monospace is a new OS, designed to bridge the <i>emotional</i> gap between humans and machines. Its purpose is to make us more aware of the interaction between ourselves and our computers by focusing on the two feet or so of unused space between our eyes and the monitor.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> What does it do?
<br>
<b>A:</b> That's not an easy one to answer. Let's just say it works. Quite well, we might add.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> How does it work?
<br>
<b>A:</b> Typing a command and pressing <tt>&lt;Return&gt;</tt> executes that command. Much like, um, Unix. For example, type <tt>beep</tt>, hit <tt>&lt;Return&gt;</tt> and see what happens. Pretty nifty eh?

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Do I need to learn Unix?
<br>
<b>A:</b> As much as you need to learn Swahili. It's impressive at parties but that's about it.

<!--
<p>
<b>Q:</b> Where's the manual?
<br>
<b>A:</b> The current Manual is an intern. His knowledge of the system is limited. But feel free to contact him directly at <a href="http://www.monospace.com/contact.html">manual@monospace.com</a> (until he gets fired or goes back to Bolivia).

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Do I <i>really</i> need the Shockwave plugin?
<br>
<b>A:</b> No. That's just to scare the newbies.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> I'm a little dense. What is Shockwave?
<br>
<b>A:</b> Let's just say that Shockwave is what makes your computer happy when you visit monospace. It's the hippest thing since sliced bread and you can get it <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/">here</a>.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> And, er, what's a plugin?
<br>
<b>A:</b> A plugin is a lot like a real world plug, except that it has no specific shape. Like its real word counterpart, a plugin needs to be inserted into a matching socket for it to work. Except that on a computer you wouldn't call it a socket either. Does that answer the question? 

<p>
<b>Q:</b> It crashed my computer! What's your name so I can sue you?
<br>
<b>A:</b> Just send an e-mail to <a href="http://www.monospace.com/contact.html">I'm_gonna_sue_your_sorry_ass@monospace.com</a>, and our friendly legal staff will take care of you. As for crashing, are you sure it was caused by <i>our</i> program? Did you doublecheck any Microsoft products that may be installed on your system? Anyway, it's your problem not ours.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> How safe is it?
<br>
<b>A:</b> It's pretty safe. Just be careful with the on/off switch because it might break. As an added precaution, you might consider wearing goggles and a hard hat (not included).

<p>
<b>Q:</b> It's talking back to me. Am I going mad?
<br>
<b>A:</b> That depends on whether you're talking back to it yourself. But seriously, madness is a condition defined differently from culture to culture. Whether you're really mad is not for us to decide. 

<p>
<b>Q:</b> How do I login as another user?
<br>
<b>A:</b> You already are.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> I want to install monospace on my own computer. What are the system requirements?
<br>
<b>A:</b> You don't know what you're saying! Ok, here we go: You'll need at least a 4 gig partition on your hard drive, in the proprietary monospace (TM) file system format. Furthermore, you'll need at least 512 megs of available RAM and a Pentium, PowerPC or Alpha processor (preferably all of  'em). A coffeemaker is highly recommended.
<br>But forget about it, we're not licensing anymore.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> I think command line interfaces are a thing of the past. When will there be a GUI version of monospace?
<br>
<b>A:</b> That is such an elitist remark! You must be one of those Mac-bigots.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Er, what's a GUI?
<br>
<b>A:</b> GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. Where have you been the last 30 years?

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Ok. But what is a Graphical User Interface?
<br>
<b>A:</b> That's alright. Even Bill Gates didn't know what it was for a long time. It's something to do with mice and windows. Ask your friendly neighborhood geek.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Are there any hidden tricks?
<br>
<b>A:</b> Yeah, lots!

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Fill me in?
<br>
<b>A:</b> Try typing in <tt>monospace</tt> and press <tt>&lt;Return&gt;</tt>.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> That's cute but what does it <i>mean</i>? And is that all?
<br>
<b>A:</b> One question at a time please. We don't know what it means but it's definitely not all.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> So what about the tag line <i>"It's between you and the screen"</i>?
<br>
<b>A:</b> Oh, lighten up already. You're being way too philosophical. We could draw a diagram for you but we feel it's pretty obvious.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> What about the future?
<br>
<b>A:</b> Ah! The future... Well, nobody really knows. Rumor has it that we're working on a hookup with some big fat DoD mainframes, but no-one at our office could verify this when asked.

<p>
<b>Q:</b> I'm disappointed. This site is a hoax.
<br>
<b>A:</b> What's your question?
