Hello and welcome to <b>Crucify!</b> God's Word game for the entire family. Play <b>Crucify!</b> whenever you feel the need to get in touch with your inner self, or instead of prayer. Your redemption is guaranteed, PLUS you'll earn bonus points for Heaven, the other exciting all new game from PRISTINEproductions, to be released shortly.

<p>

<b>Crucify!</b> is based loosely on the old Hangman game, with a slightly modified theme to suit your spiritual needs. Whether you're  a Catholic or a Protestant, or just a plain old-fashioned bigot, God's Word has something for everyone. And it's so easy even your kids can play it!

<p>

To play, just click on any of the letters in the bottom row to find God's Word. If His Word doesn't contain that letter, a body part of the Lord is added to the Cross. When the game ends, just click "New Word" to start another.

<p>

Remember: the family that plays together stays together!

<p>

<b>This game was designed for screens at least 800x600 pixels. Please allow for all sounds and graphic elements to download completely before playing.</b>
