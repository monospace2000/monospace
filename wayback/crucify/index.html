Hello and welcome to <b>Crucify!</b> God's Word game for the entire family. Play <b>Crucify!</b> whenever you feel the need to get in touch with your inner self, or instead of prayer. Your spiritual satisfaction is guaranteed, PLUS you'll earn bonus points for Heaven, the other exciting all new game from PRISTINE Multimedia, to be released shortly.

<p>

<b>Crucify!</b> is based loosely on the old Hangman game, with a slightly modified theme to suit your spiritual needs. Whether you're  a Catholic or a Protestant, or just a plain old-fashioned bigot, God's Word has something for everyone. And it's so easy even your kids can play it!

<p>

To play, just click on any of the letters in the bottom row to find God's Word. If His Word doesn't contain that letter, a body part of the Lord is added to the Cross. When the game ends, just click "New Word" to start another.

<p>

Remember: The family that plays together stays together!
