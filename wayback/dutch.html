<p id="headline">Dutch word of the day</p>
<span id="text">
<p>The Dutch word of the day is, well, a Dutch word, carefully selected by me each day, from memory. That's because I am Dutch, and Dutch is a peculiar language. 
<p>Words are chosen not necessarily for their meaning -- in fact most of the words up here I picked because they <b>sound</b> or <b>look</b> interesting. 
<p>NEW (01/09/2001): You can now click on the word and listen to it, in MP3 format.
